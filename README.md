# Beamer Presentation Template for UNIPD

Thi is the template I use to create presentations using Beamer (Latex). 

Full credit is owed to [UFGTex-Presentation](https://github.com/deuslirio/UFGTeX-Presentation), the template I took and modified to my needs in order to obtain this current template (e.g. changed the logos to use the ones of my university and department and added some features like code boxes).

Feel free to use and modify this template as you prefer. 

## Known issues:
Using Adobe Acrobat Reader on Windows might not show the correct colors or logos on slides. Not sure why this is the case but on Linux, using Okular or the standard document reader i have no problems.
